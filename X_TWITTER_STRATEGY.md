## 🔥 High-Engagement Tweet Templates

### Template 1: "Build in Public" Thread
```
🚀 Built a production AI system with @AnthropicAI Claude that generates $500/month

Here's how I went from 0 to production in 65 days 🧵

1/ The Problem:
Grant research was taking 40 hours. Clients needed faster, more comprehensive results.

Enter Claude Agent SDK. 🤖

[Continue thread with 8-10 tweets showing journey]
```

### Template 2: "Code Snippet + Result"
```
💡 This Claude Agent SDK pattern increased my multi-agent response time by 160x

The secret? Intelligent routing + parallel execution

Here's the code pattern: 👇

[Image: Code snippet from your orchestration.py]

Works great for [use case]. Try it yourself!
```

### Template 3: "Metrics Achievement"
```
📊 Just hit a milestone with my Claude-powered system:

✅ 363,000+ lines of production code
✅ 99.8% uptime
✅ $500 MRR from ONE client
✅ 14x faster development than traditional methods

All built with @AnthropicAI Claude Agent SDK in 65 days

Thread on how: 🧵
```

### Template 4: "Problem → Solution"
```
❌ Problem: Manual grant research = 40 hours/search

✅ Solution: Claude multi-agent system = 15 minutes

💰 Result: 160x faster, 10x ROI for client

Built with @AnthropicAI Claude Agent SDK

Here's the architecture [image] + lessons learned 👇
```

### Template 5: "Educational How-To"
```
How to build a multi-agent system with @AnthropicAI Claude SDK

(That actually ships to production)

A thread 🧵

1/ Start with a clear orchestration pattern
Not all agents should do everything...

[Continue with practical tutorial]
```

### Template 6: "Interactive Visualization"
```
📈 Made an interactive dashboard showing my Claude Agent SDK development metrics

- 363K lines of code
- 5 production systems
- 127 commits across 65 days
- 918x cost efficiency

Live demo: [link to your portfolio-visualizations.html]

Everything built with @AnthropicAI Claude 🚀
```

### Template 7: "Engaging Question"
```
Question for Claude Agent SDK developers:

What's your biggest challenge with multi-agent orchestration?

For me it was [your challenge]. Solved it by [solution].

Drop yours below 👇 I'll share solutions I found
```

### Template 8: "Hot Take / Insight"
```
Hot take:

Multi-agent systems are NOT about having 100 agents.

It's about having the RIGHT agents with CLEAR responsibilities.

I ship production systems with 6 specialized agents. Here's why that works better: 🧵
```

### Template 9: "Before/After Comparison"
```
Before Claude Agent SDK:
❌ 40 hours of manual research
❌ 3-5 grant programs found
❌ Human error prone
❌ Can't scale

After Claude Agent SDK:
✅ 15 minutes automated
✅ 20+ programs identified
✅ 95%+ accuracy
✅ Scales infinitely

The blueprint: 👇
```

### Template 10: "Weekend Project Share"
```
