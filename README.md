## 🎯 What Makes Me Different

**Blue-Collar Background Meets Cutting-Edge AI**

My unconventional path is my competitive advantage. I've operated heavy machinery, conducted energy audits, managed FDA-compliant manufacturing, and coordinated live events. At every job, I identified operational inefficiencies and envisioned technology solutions.

Now I build them.

I understand how businesses actually operate—the permits, the compliance requirements, the stakeholders who need solutions explained without jargon. Combined with deep proficiency in Claude Agent SDK and multi-agent orchestration, I deliver AI solutions that work on day one because they're built by someone who's lived the problems they solve.
