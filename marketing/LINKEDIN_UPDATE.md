## ABOUT SECTION (2,600 characters max)

```
I build AI agents AND the infrastructure that powers them.

Most AI developers come from software. I came from crawl spaces, construction sites, and concert venues. I've operated heavy machinery at dawn and mixed live sound at midnight. I've walked through warehouses, production floors, and office buildings doing energy audits.

Every single place I worked, I saw the same thing: inefficiency hiding in plain sight. Paper forms that should be automated. Tribal knowledge that walked out the door when someone quit. Compliance tracking done in spreadsheets nobody trusted.

That frustration became my mission.

Now I build production AI systems that solve the exact problems I witnessed for years. My current employer's grant tracking system? I built it. Their energy rebate calculator? Mine too. That's not a portfolio project - that's production code handling real money.

WHAT I BUILD:
→ AI agents with Claude SDK and multi-agent orchestration
→ MCP servers that extend AI capabilities
→ Production systems deployed to Railway with WebSocket streaming
→ n8n automation workflows for enterprise operations
→ Full-stack applications (FastAPI + React)

BY THE NUMBERS:
• 75,000+ lines of production code
• 5 production systems deployed
• $500/month recurring revenue
• 12 AI tools/agents built
• 6+ years energy sector experience
• ComEd & OSHA certified

MY EDGE:
Most candidates know either AI development OR business operations. I've done both. I understand how enterprises actually work - the permits, the compliance, the stakeholders who need solutions explained without jargon.

CURRENTLY:
• Building EV_LV Grant Intelligence Platform (live on Railway)
• Developing ADEV Agent Orchestration Dashboard
• Shipping AI SaaS platform (launching Jan 2026)

LOOKING FOR:
AI Agent Developer, MCP Developer, Developer Tools Engineer, or AI Platform Engineer roles. Open to remote, hybrid, or Chicago-based opportunities.

Let's connect if you're building agentic AI systems or need someone who can bridge the gap between technology and real-world operations.

## POST IDEAS (After Updating Profile)

**Post 1: The Announcement**
```
I just updated my LinkedIn to reflect a career pivot I've been building toward for the past year.

From heavy machinery operator → energy auditor → event producer → AI Agent Developer.

Unusual path? Yes. But that's the point.

Every job taught me something:
• Construction: logistics, safety protocols, coordination
• Energy audits: how businesses actually operate
• Events: real-time problem solving, compliance

Now I build AI systems that solve the problems I spent years watching go unsolved.

Currently shipping:
→ Production AI platform with 12 specialized tools
→ $500/mo recurring revenue
→ 75,000+ lines of code

Looking for AI Agent Developer or Developer Tools Engineer roles.

If you're building agentic AI systems, let's connect.
