## Usage Notes

These materials are designed for professional outreach while protecting client confidentiality and proprietary code. Always:

1. Use generic code patterns, not actual client implementations
2. Share architecture, not business logic
3. Highlight metrics without exposing sensitive data
4. Keep client names anonymous unless permission granted
