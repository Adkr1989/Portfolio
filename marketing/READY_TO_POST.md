## LinkedIn Post #1 - Introduction (POST TODAY)

```
I've been quietly building AI agent systems for the past 65 days.

The results:
- 90,000+ lines of production code
- 186 commits across 5 deployed systems
- Paying clients with recurring revenue
- 160x efficiency improvement (40 hours -> 15 minutes)

My secret weapon? Claude Agent SDK + MCP servers.

Coming from construction and energy consulting, I saw the same problem everywhere: businesses drowning in manual processes that technology could solve.

Now I build those solutions.

Current projects:
1. Business Intelligence Platform (LIVE) - AI-powered research automation
2. Agent Orchestration Dashboard - Multi-agent coordination
3. Compliance Platform - FDA/HACCP automation
4. Consumer SaaS - Launching January 2026

All built with @Anthropic's Claude Agent SDK.

## LinkedIn Post #2 - Technical Deep Dive

```
How I built a multi-agent system that coordinates 6 specialized AI agents:

The Architecture:
┌──────────────────────────┐
│   Orchestration Layer    │
│    (Claude Agent SDK)    │
└───────────┬──────────────┘
            │
    ┌───────┴───────┐
    │   6 Subagents │
    ├───────────────┤
    │ Research Analyst
    │ Compliance Expert
    │ Form Filler
    │ Documentation Writer
    │ Workflow Builder
    │ Agent Developer
    └───────────────┘

Key patterns that made it work:
1. WebSocket streaming for real-time updates
2. API key auth for security
3. MCP servers for tool integration
4. Automatic task delegation

Tech: Claude API, FastAPI, Python, HTTPS/TLS

The code patterns are in my Portfolio (MIT license):

Happy to answer questions in comments!

Hey HF community!

I'm Ari, an AI developer from Chicago building production agent systems.

Been working with Claude Agent SDK and MCP servers, but also exploring the HF ecosystem for local model deployment and embeddings.

Current projects:
- Business Intelligence Platform - Production AI for research automation (160x faster than manual)
- Multi-agent orchestration - 6 specialized subagents coordinating via WebSocket
- Compliance AI - Local Ollama deployment for FDA/HACCP (zero API costs)

Interested in:
- Transformer architectures for domain-specific fine-tuning
- Local LLM deployment patterns (Ollama, OpenVINO)
- Vector embeddings for RAG systems
- Agent frameworks that play nice with HF models

Tech stack: Python, FastAPI, Claude API, Ollama, PostgreSQL

Open source portfolio: github.com/Adkr1989/Portfolio

What's everyone working on? Always looking to learn about HF integrations!

## Discord Post - Claude Code Showcase Channel

```
Just shipped a multi-agent system using Claude Code!

The Setup:
- 6 specialized subagents (research analyst, compliance expert, form filler, documentation writer, workflow builder, agent developer)
- WebSocket streaming for real-time updates
- API key auth + HTTPS/TLS for security
- MCP servers for tool integration

What it does:
- Research automation: 40 hours -> 15 minutes (160x faster)
- Compliance checking: FDA/GMP/HACCP validation
- Auto-fill forms with extracted data
- Generate documentation automatically

Stats: 90K+ lines, 186 commits, paying clients

The patterns that made it work:
1. Subagent specialization > one giant prompt
2. MCP servers for external tool access
3. WebSocket streaming for real-time feedback
4. Secure deployment (Railway + TLS)

Code patterns available (MIT license): github.com/Adkr1989/Portfolio

Happy to answer any questions about the architecture!

## Twitter/X Thread (Optional)

```
Thread: How I built a production AI system in 65 days 🧵

1/ Started with a problem: Business research takes 40 hours per project.

My client needed a faster way.

Solution: Build an AI agent.
```

```
2/ The stack:
- Claude API for intelligence
- Node.js + TypeScript backend
- Railway for deployment
- n8n for automation
- PostgreSQL for data

Result: 15 minutes instead of 40 hours
```

```
3/ Key insight: Multi-agent > Single agent

I built 6 specialized agents:
- Research Analyst
- Compliance Checker
- Form Filler
- Documentation Writer

Each agent is an expert in its domain.
```

```
4/ The MCP pattern changed everything.

Model Context Protocol lets Claude:
- Use custom tools
- Access external APIs
- Execute workflows

It's like giving AI hands.
```

```
5/ Now shipping:
- Paying clients
- 99.8% uptime
- 160x efficiency gains

All the code patterns are MIT licensed:
github.com/Adkr1989/Portfolio
