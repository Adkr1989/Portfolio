- Different audience (edge/on-premise deployments)
- Shows breadth of knowledge
- Maine Scientific project uses Ollama

### **Ollama Platforms**

**Primary:**
- Discord: https://discord.gg/ollama
- GitHub: https://github.com/ollama/ollama
- Reddit: r/ollama
- X: @ollama

**Content to Share:**
- Your Maine Scientific platform (Ollama-based)

### **Sample Ollama Content**

**Discord/Reddit Post:**
```
Built a FDA compliance platform using Ollama for complete data privacy

Key points:
• 100% local deployment (994MB model)
• Zero API costs
• Full HIPAA/FDA compliance
• PowerShell automation integration

For clients who can't use cloud LLMs, this works great.

Architecture: [link to Maine Scientific docs]

Questions welcome 👍
```

**X Post:**
```
@ollama for privacy-critical AI ✅
@AnthropicAI Claude for powerful cloud AI ✅

Why not both?

I use:
• Ollama for FDA-compliant local processing
• Claude for complex analysis & orchestration

Hybrid architecture gives clients best of both worlds

Thread on implementation 🧵

Excited to share a milestone 🎉

My Claude-powered AI system just crossed 30 days of 99.8% uptime while generating $500/month recurring revenue.

Key lessons from shipping production AI systems:

1. Start with clear business value (not cool tech)
2. Obsess over reliability (99.8% > 95%)
3. Measure what matters (revenue, not features)

For hiring managers: I'm open to opportunities building production AI systems that solve real business problems.

Tech stack: Claude Agent SDK, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Railway

5 mistakes I made building multi-agent AI systems

(So you don't have to)

After shipping 5 production systems with Claude Agent SDK:

❌ Mistake #1: Too many agents
Started with 15, now use 6. More isn't better.

❌ Mistake #2: No intelligent routing
Random assignment = poor results. Need Claude-powered routing.

❌ Mistake #3: Synchronous execution
Serial processing = slow. Parallel = 160x faster.

Building production AI? These patterns saved me months.
