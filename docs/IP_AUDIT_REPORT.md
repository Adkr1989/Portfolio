**Audit Date:** February 4, 2026
**Repository:** Adkr1989/Portfolio
**Status:** PASS with recommendations

---

## Executive Summary

| Category | Status | Findings |
|----------|--------|----------|
| **Credentials/Secrets** | ✅ SAFE | No exposed API keys or tokens |
| **Client Names** | ⚠️ REVIEW | 2 clients named publicly |
| **Code Samples** | ✅ SAFE | Generic patterns, properly sanitized |
| **Revenue Details** | ⚠️ REVIEW | Specific amounts disclosed |

---

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Credentials & Secrets: ✅ SAFE

**Scanned for:**
- API keys (`sk-`, `api_key`, `secret`)
- OAuth tokens
- Passwords
- Database credentials

**Result:** No hardcoded secrets found. All code samples reference environment variables appropriately.

```python
# Example from code (SAFE):
os.getenv("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")
os.getenv("API_KEY")
```

---

### 2. Client Names: ⚠️ REQUIRES VERIFICATION

**Found mentions of:**

| Client | Files Mentioning | Risk Level |
|--------|------------------|------------|
| Law Ventures LTD | 7 files | Medium |
| Maine Scientific | 5 files | Medium |

**Files with client mentions:**
- `README.md`
- `cv.html`
- `docs/BENCHMARKS.md`
- `docs/index-professional.html`
- `docs/index-terminal.html`
- `projects/evlv-grant-platform/README.md`
- `marketing/*.md` files

**Recommendation:**
- Verify written permission from clients to be named publicly
- OR replace with generic descriptions:
  - "Law Ventures LTD" → "Energy consulting client"
  - "Maine Scientific" → "Food manufacturing client"

---

### 3. Code Samples: ✅ SAFE

**Analysis:**
- `multi_agent_orchestration.py` - Generic patterns only
- `websocket_streaming.py` - Standard FastAPI patterns
- `mcp_integration.py` - Template code only
- All files contain sanitization notices

**Example disclaimer found:**
```python
# NOTE: This is a sanitized example showing the pattern, not production code.
```

---

### 4. Revenue Details: ⚠️ REVIEW

**Disclosed amounts:**
- "$500/month" recurring revenue
- "$458,900" development value
- "918x" cost efficiency

**Risk:** Low - These are marketing metrics, not confidential client financials.

**Recommendation:** Consider ranges if concerned:
- "$500/month" → "$500+/month"
- Keep efficiency metrics as-is (impressive for hiring)

---

### 5. .gitignore Review: ✅ PROPERLY CONFIGURED

```gitignore
# Sensitive files excluded:
.env
*.pem
*.key
credentials.json
*.db
```

---

## Action Items

### Required Before Publishing:
- [ ] Verify client permission for "Law Ventures LTD" mention
- [ ] Verify client permission for "Maine Scientific" mention

### Optional Improvements:
- [ ] Consider anonymizing to "Energy consulting client"
- [ ] Consider anonymizing to "Manufacturing compliance client"
- [ ] Add revenue ranges instead of exact figures

---

## Audit Conclusion

**Portfolio is SAFE to publish** with the following caveats:
1. Get written client permission, OR
2. Anonymize client names before broader distribution

**No security vulnerabilities detected.**
